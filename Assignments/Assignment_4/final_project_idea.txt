I have data from the project I'm working with Dr. Hjelmen on, specifically I've got some longevity data and genome size data and am working on gathering more from currently existing databases and research papers. The goal is to compare the difference in lifespan of homogametic and heterogametic individuals with the difference in their respective genome sizes. I think I could do this or a similar comparison for my final project.
